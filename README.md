I'm Alavy from Bangladesh, and I am very passionate about technology as a whole.
But I am biased toward Game Dev.I like to play games as much as like to make them.My favorite game engine is Unity so far. I also tried Godot but it seems un-polish. 
Another Reason I like unity is for C# which is my favorite Programing Language. I also tried low level graphics programing with OpenGL in C++ Which helped me to better grasp certain graphics topics like shading, texturing, transformation, Co-ordinates system etc.
